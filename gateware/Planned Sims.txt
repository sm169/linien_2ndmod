Use yield to step thru 1 cycle at a time not possible to skip cycles

To test for lots of clock cycles migen simulator is too slow so it is best to convert to verilog and run in a verilog simulator that is faster i.e. verilator
	
Use Cocotb for faster simulations in verilator/other simulators

	Cocotb is written in python so it would allow you debug higher level python (e.g. in linien server) and simulate the fpga code in the same code file?
	
	Write interface that hands migen code to cocotb nicely:
		Convert migen code to verilog
		
		Presents register names to cocotb
		
		Ensure that external python code is writing to the correct registers
		
Write script that reconverts migen file and runs cocotb sim if nothing needs to be changed in the cocotb sim
